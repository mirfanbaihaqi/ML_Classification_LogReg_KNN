# Machine Learning Classification (LogReg & KNN)
On this project Machine Learning Classification, I used 2 models. There are Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset that i used is telco, same case with data preprocessing before.

## Overview
Customer churn is the loss of clients or customers. In order to avoid losing customers, a company needs to examine why its customers have left in the past and which features are more important to determine who will churn in the future. Our task is therefore to predict whether customers are about to churn and which are the most important features to get that prediction right. As in most prediction problems, we will use machine learning.

There are several important step that you have to do until you get the result.
* Input Libraries
* Load the data
* Data understanding
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data cleaning
* Data preprocessing
* Data partition
* Modelling
* Evaluation Model

Because of the dataset is imbalance data, we must not see only by its accuracy. We can use classification report to see another result from the model that we used before. From classification report we can see the value of precision, recall, and F1-score. These values can be a benchmark for how good the model is used in the case of the dataset which has imbalance data. In Logistic Regression, i got 77% accuracy, its better then KNN Method which has 73% accuracy. These are the result of both models that i used to predict the dataset.

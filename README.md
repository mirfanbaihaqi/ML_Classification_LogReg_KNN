# Machine Learning Classification (LogReg & KNN)
On this project Machine Learning Classification, I used 2 models. There are Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset that i used is telco, same case with data preprocessing before.

## Overview
Customer churn is the loss of clients or customers. In order to avoid losing customers, a company needs to examine why its customers have left in the past and which features are more important to determine who will churn in the future. Our task is therefore to predict whether customers are about to churn and which are the most important features to get that prediction right. As in most prediction problems, we will use machine learning.

There are several important step that you have to do until you get the result.
* Input Libraries
* Load the data
* Data understanding
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data cleaning
* Data preprocessing
* Data partition
* Modelling
* Evaluation Model
